       <div class='reportDivision'><h3 class='orangeBar'>History of the Collection</h3>
           <div class='divisionContent'>
                <p>The history of the Lake Superior Division collection is a bit murky. We know that the Division was originally headquartered in Science Hall at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Some of the hand samples were likely lost when the building burned in 1884. Between that time and 1967, when the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey moved from the UW-Madison campus into a building of its own, we came into possession of the hand samples, thin sections, and paper records. According to a set of handwritten transmittal documents, thin sections and field notebooks were shipped to the USGS facility in Reston, Virginia, by Charles Dutton in 1976. These transmittal documents are vague, though, and make no mention of hand samples.</p>

               </div>
				
				<p>Though presumably the hand samples had remained in Madison, in fact, parts of that collection had been harvested as teaching samples for university geology departments across Wisconsin. In addition, samples were stored at different times in various locations in Madison and Milwaukee and, with each move, some were lost.</p> 
				
				

				<p>In 1981, William F. Cannon, Chief of the Branch of Eastern Mineral Resources at the USGS, returned the notebooks and thin sections to Madison writing to WGNHS that we would do “a great service if you can reassemble the notes, thin sections, and rock samples into a single collection.” </p>
 

                <p>After WGNHS acquired the collection, the pieces sat in storage for 30 years before any work was done. Lack of resources, and a general lack of awareness of the importance as well as the procedures of data preservation meant that we were not yet equipped to give this collection the attention it deserved. </p>

                <p>This changed with the initiation of the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program at the USGS. In 2012, WGNHS applied to the USGS for a grant to do preservation work on the Lake Superior Legacy Collection. The Survey has received subsequent grants in 2013, 2014, and 2016.</p>


				<p>The first two years of the project were spent inventorying the collection, building a database, and capturing metadata for the hand samples and thin sections from the field notebooks, specimen catalog, and other paper records. Partnering with the UW-Digital Collections, we began scanning the field notebooks and making them available online.</p>

               </div>
				
				<p>In 2014, with most the collection inventoried, and metadata from the notebooks largely complete, we set out to photograph all of the thin sections in plane- and cross polar light. Before being photographed, each thin section was cleaned. One of the WGNHS geologists built a frame to hold the camera, insuring that the plane- and cross-polarized light photos would line up exactly.</p>

                </div>
				
				<p>During those years, we made a complete inventory of the collection, built a database to index all of the elements down to the single sample, photographed nearly all of the thin sections in our possession, and partnered with the UW Digital Collections to scan the field notebooks and lithological descriptions. 
                In the final year of our work on the collection, we have built this web interface, which provides online access to the scanned field notebooks and lithological descriptions, the thin section photographs and the hand sample records.</p>
