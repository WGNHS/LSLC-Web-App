                <p>The provenance of the collection is uncertain at best. We know that it was housed in Science Hall at the University of Wisconsin in Madison while the Survey was active. Some of the hand samples were likely lost when the building burned in 1884. At some point, the collection was moved to the USGS facility in Reston, Virginia. In 1981, William F. Cannon, Chief of the Branch of Eastern Mineral Resources at the USGS, returned the collection to Madison writing to WGNHS that we would do “a great service if you can reassemble the notes, thin sections, and rock samples into a single collection.” </p>
 
                <p>Unfortunately, by the time the collection came into the possession of the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, it was no longer complete. Parts of the hand sample collection had been harvested as teaching samples for university geology departments across Wisconsin. In addition, samples were stored at different times in various locations in Madison and Milwaukee and, with each move, some were lost. There is a catalog of photographs, but not a single photo survives, and there are a number of missing notebooks and thin sections.  </p>

                <p>WGNHS acquired what was left of the collection in 1981, and the pieces sat in storage for 30 years before any work was done. Lack of resources, and a general lack of awareness of the importance as well as the procedures of data preservation meant that we were not yet equipped to give this collection the attention it deserved. </p>

                <p>This changed with the initiation of the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program at the USGS. In 2012, WGNHS applied to the USGS for a grant to do preservation work on the Lake Superior Legacy Collection. The Survey has received subsequent grants in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. During those years, we made a complete inventory of the collection, built a database to index all of the elements down to the single sample, photographed all of the thin sections in our possession, and partnered with the UW Digital Collections to scan the field notebooks and lithological descriptions. 
                In the final year of our work on the collection, we have built this web interface, which provides online access to the scanned field notebooks and lithological descriptions, the thin section photographs and the hand sample records. (See About the Data Viewer for more information on how to use this resource.) </p>
