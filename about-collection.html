           <div class='divisionContent'>
                <p>The basic elements of the collection are hand samples, thin sections, maps, field notebooks, and lithological descriptions. Geologists embarked on field expeditions, travelling to the areas they were studying, where they collected hand samples, or pieces of rock that could be held in the palm of a hand. They recorded observations of the sites they visited, including descriptions of the hand samples, in field notebooks. The hand samples were brought back to Madison, where some were cut to create one or more thin sections--slices of rock thin enough to allow light to pass through them. These thin sections were viewed under a microscope in both plane-polarized and cross-polarized light. Geologists then recorded their observations of the thin sections in lithological descriptions. Parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were mapped on large-scale, hand drawn and colored maps that show the topography, geology, and locations from which hand samples were taken. Some of those maps are within the collection; many have been lost. </p>
