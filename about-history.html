           <div class='divisionContent'>
               <p>Roland D. Irving, Wisconsin’s first true geologist, established the Lake Superior Division of the USGS in 1882 in Madison, Wisconsin. As head of the Division, Irving began a detailed survey of the Upper Midwest during which he pioneered the application of microscopic petrography (thin sections). After Irving’s untimely death in 1888, the Division’s fieldwork continued under subsequent directors C.R. Van Hise and C.K. Leith. For 40 years, geologists from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan studied the geology of the Lake Superior area and laid the groundwork for all later investigations of the region’s Precambrian rocks (Dott, 2001).</p>
 
               <p> Mineral exploration was one of the primary drivers for the survey, and much of the Lake Superior Division’s work was concentrated in copper- and iron-rich areas of the Lake Superior area, including the Marquette region of Michigan, the Menominee and Gogebic regions of Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Lake Vermilion and Mesabi regions of Minnesota.</p>

               <p>The Upper Peninsula was mapped in highly detailed large-scale, hand drawn maps, and extensive work was done in the Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury areas of Ontario. Of the 35,000 hand samples described in the field notebooks, more than half were taken in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, a thriving area for iron mining in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. </p>
 
               <p>Geologists from the Division, especially Charles Van Hise and C.K. Leith also traveled widely throughout the United States and even overseas. Some of the samples and field notes cover Appalachia, New England, Utah, Colorado, eastern Canada and even Germany and the United Kingdom. However, metadata for many of these samples is vague. One of the products of this research was a massive volume on the Precambrian geology of the United States (Bulletin 360, Leith and Van Hise). </p>
 
               <p>Over the years, the Division produced a large number of publications, including nine monographs, three bulletins, and a professional paper. (A list of the major publications of the Lake Superior Division can be found below.) </p>
 
               <p>The raw data used to produce these publications comprises the Lake Superior Legacy Collection. Some of that data has been lost or disbursed; the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey has 464 field notebooks, 9794 hand samples, 15,608 thin sections, 6 books of microscopic lithological descriptions, and some miscellaneous paper records. (A complete list of the collection, with a comparison to what, as much as we know, was originally in the collection, is below.)</p>
